# Microcontroller-Traffic-Light-Control-8051
Microcontroller Traffic Light Control 8051 Our objective of this project is to simulate the traffic light system with pedestrian crossing. In day mode, the sequence of traffic lights and pedestrian crossing signals, including green, yellow, and red lights for both traffic and pedestrians. In night mode, it is a constant blinking yellow light for traffic. Microcontroller Traffic Light Control (8051 Assembly code):

This assembly code is designed to control a traffic light system using an 8051 microcontroller. It includes logic to handle both regular and pedestrian modes based on the state of a physical switch (switch1). In pedestrian mode, it allows pedestrians to cross the road safely by controlling the traffic and pedestrian lights in a synchronized manner. In regular mode, it simulates the typical sequence of traffic lights, transitioning between green, yellow, and red lights for traffic. The code demonstrates the use of timer interrupts for generating accurate delays, essential for coordinating the timing of the traffic light sequence. It showcases low-level hardware control and efficient use of the microcontroller's resources to achieve the desired functionality.
